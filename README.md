Welcome to the **Big Data Analytics and ML for World Cup 2022 Winner Prediction** project repository. This project aims to predict the winners of the FIFA World Cup 2022 using logistic regression and Apache-Spark in Databricks cloud. We utilize historical data from various sources to build and evaluate our predictive model.

## Overview

The FIFA World Cup is one of the most anticipated sporting events globally, and predicting the outcomes of its matches is an exciting challenge. In this project, we use big data analytics and machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to predict the winners of World Cup 2022 matches based on historical data.

## Datasets

We have included three essential datasets to facilitate this analysis:

1. **WC22 Dataset**: This dataset contains information about the teams participating in the FIFA World Cup 2022, including team names, group assignments, and initial rankings.

2. **FIFA Rankings Dataset**: This dataset provides historical FIFA rankings for national soccer teams. Accurate rankings play a crucial role in our prediction model.

3. **All Soccer Games Ever Played Dataset**: This dataset comprises a comprehensive list of all soccer games ever played, including details such as teams, scores, and dates. This data is used to gather historical performance information for teams.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone [https://github.com/khalil-ghali/World-Cup-2022-Prediction-Model].git
   
# Exploring the Notebooks
Navigate to the `notebooks` directory to find the Jupyter notebooks used in this project. Start with the `world_cup_prediction.ipynb` notebook for an in-depth understanding of the prediction process.

## Data Files
Load the provided datasets (`WC22.csv`, `FIFA_rankings.csv`, and `all_soccer_games.csv`) and modify the directory inside the notebook.

## Run the Code
Follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the code and explore the prediction results.

## Usage

This project is divided into several Jupyter notebooks that guide you through different stages of the analysis and prediction process. Here's a brief overview of the notebooks:

- **01_Data_Preparation.ipynb**: This notebook covers data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- **02_Model_Training.ipynb**: Here, we train our logistic regression model using historical data.
- **03_Model_Evaluation.ipynb**: Evaluate the model's performance and analyze the results.
- **04_World_Cup_Prediction.ipynb**: Use the trained model to predict World Cup 2022 match outcomes.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to gain insights into our analysis and prediction methods.
